Changes the order of the admin menu to suit the needs of our customers. Places some of the items under a new "admin" area for WordPress Administrators. Styles the menu to suit the custom admin theme.

### Building notes
You should install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to run
the commands below and work on Node v12 for this build. This uses Laravel Mix to build everything.

```
nvm use 12
npx mix
```
